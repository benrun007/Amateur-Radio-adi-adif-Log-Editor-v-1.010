The ADI File Editor is a custom tool designed to edit and supplement log files in the ADIF format (Amateur Data Interchange Format). This program is particularly useful for radio amateurs who use modes such as FT8 or FT4. Here is a summary of the essential functions and features of the editor:

Functions and Features of the ADI File Editor:

Load and Save Files: The editor allows you to load and save log files with the .adi file extension. If the file has the .adif extension, it must be renamed to .adi to be used with this editor.

Editing Log Entries: All fields of a log entry can be edited. This includes, for example, callsigns (call), grid squares (gridsquare), mode (mode), sent and received signal reports (rst_sent, rst_rcvd), date and time of the QSO (qso_date, time_on), frequency (freq), used transmission power (tx_pwr), and comments.

Navigation and Editing:

Navigation: The editor allows you to navigate through the entries by jumping to the first, last, previous, or next entry.
New Entries: New log entries can be created.
Delete Entries: Entries can be deleted.
Filter Entries: It is possible to filter by specific criteria using the corresponding fields.
Display of Entries: Information such as the counterparty's callsign, your own grid square, the mode, the sent and received signal reports, the date and time of the QSO, and other details are clearly displayed.
